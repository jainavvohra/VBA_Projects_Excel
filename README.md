I have successfully completed a 21-hour Excel course, covering both basic and advanced Excel topics, during which I created 6 VBA projects:

1. Formats headers with a button click.
2. Formats headers for multiple sheets simultaneously.
3. Automatically sums columns in all sheets.
4. Sorts a table according to three criteria with a button click.
5. Adds and formats headers, combines data from all sheets into one, and sums them.
6. Creates a user form to select a worksheet using a dropdown menu, add a sheet, and run a report.# VBA_Projects_Excel
